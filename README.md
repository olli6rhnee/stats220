âœ¨Welcome to my first project in Githubâœ¨


_This is an assignment from STATS 220 about Creating HTML by combining modern technologies_


# The main tasks are:
1. Create a still meme with pictures and annotation
2. Create a GIF animation
3. Decorate your html with some CSS codes


## Interesting part
In terms of the meme, I'm almost satisfied with it but I think it's funny. So it's okay.

And I really like my GIF animation because it was inspired by some __pixel game__ I played. I take the same understanding that animation is supported frame by frame and it is a great learning expereince for me.

# The project
I think it might be easier if you could find them [here](https://olli6rhnee.github.io/stats220/).
